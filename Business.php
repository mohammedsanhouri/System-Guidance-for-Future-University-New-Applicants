                    <h3></h3>
										<p>Business is ubiquitous in our society. We conduct business in a variety of ways every day, including using smartphones, streaming shows, and purchasing food. In-store or online, our day-to-day activities or the items we purchase all begin with a business idea. 

People's personalities shape their preferences and what they deem essential. That's where businesses come in. Behind the scenes, various business professionals are working toward an organization's goals. Whatever the goods or services an organization sells to consumers, it's your job to ensure your company's objectives are met.

As a business student, you'll take accounting, finance, economics, marketing, human resources, and project management classes. And because today's society is immersed in technology, your coursework will include classes on how the digital world impacts businesses.</p>

											<h3>Your Major Matters</h3>
											<p>Choosing a major could be an even more important decision than which college to choose. Studies have shown that students who choose a major that is a good fit for them tend to get better grades and are also more likely to graduate on time. Your future salary also largely depends on your major, even more so than the college you choose.</p>
