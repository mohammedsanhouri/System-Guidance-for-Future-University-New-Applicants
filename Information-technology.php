										<p>IT majors focus on how information and computing systems support business, research, and communications needs. Instruction ranges from the basics of computer hardware to the complex relationship between humans and computers.</p>
										<div class="line"></div>
										<p>As an information technology (IT) major, you'll study computer science, business, and communications. Along the way, you might focus on one specialty such as web development or digital communications. But regardless of your focus, youâ€™ll acquire strong technical and communication skills.

											<h3>Your Major Matters</h3>
											<p>Choosing a major could be an even more important decision than which college to choose. Studies have shown that students who choose a major that is a good fit for them tend to get better grades and are also more likely to graduate on time. Your future salary also largely depends on your major, even more so than the college you choose.</p>

											<p><strong></strong><p>
											<p>Since an IT major involves taking core courses in several different departments, many students end up with a specialty or track in one area of interest. For example, you may decide to specialize in Web development and take classes such as Web page design and database development for the Web. Or you may be drawn to digital communications and take classes in telecommunications networks and the science of telephones. </p>
